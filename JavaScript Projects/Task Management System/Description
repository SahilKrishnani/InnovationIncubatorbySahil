Task Management System

The goal of this project is to build a task management system where users can:

Add new tasks with a description and priority level.
View all tasks.
Update task descriptions and priority levels.
Delete tasks.
Fetch additional task-related information from an external API (simulated).
The project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts and is structured in a way that could be useful for an AI Engineer Intern role by emphasizing data handling and asynchronous operations.
