The goal of this project is to build a weather data analysis system where users can:

Fetch current weather data for a given city from an external API.
Store the fetched data.
Perform basic data analysis such as finding the highest and lowest temperatures from the stored data.
Calculate the average temperature from the stored data.
The project demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts and is structured to showcase API interaction, data manipulation, and basic analysis, which are relevant skills for an AI Engineer Intern.
