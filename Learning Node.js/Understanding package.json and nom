package.json is a file that holds metadata about your Node.js project. 
It includes important information such as the project name, version, dependencies, 
scripts, and more. Here is an example of a simple package.json file:

  "description": "A sample Node.js project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}

name: The name of your project.
version: The version of your project.
