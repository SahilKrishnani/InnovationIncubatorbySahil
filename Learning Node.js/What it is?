Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling you to build server-side 
applications with JavaScript. Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, 
which makes it lightweight and efficient, ideal for building scalable network applications.
