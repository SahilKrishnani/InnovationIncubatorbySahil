To set up a Node.js project, follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) automatically.

Initialize a new Node.js project:

Create a new directory for your project.
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
Run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. This command will create a package.json file and prompt you to enter various details about your project.

mkdir my-node-project
cd my-node-project
npm init

During the npm init process, you'll be asked to provide:

Package name
Version
Description
Entry point (default is index.js)
Test command
Git repository
Keywords
Author
License
After filling in the information, npm will generate a package.json file based on your inputs.
